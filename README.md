# 👋 Hello, I'm Cem UĞUZ

I'm a **Computational Physicist (PhD)** and a full-time researcher at [**HiTMer – Center for Computational Drug Design**](https://www.durdagilab.com). My work focuses on building **AI-powered molecular modeling frameworks**, combining **physics-based simulations**, **deep learning**, and **generative models** for drug discovery.

## 🔬 Research Interests & Expertise

I design and develop modular scientific pipelines with a strong emphasis on:

- 🧬 **Molecular Dynamics (GROMACS, NAMD, OpenMM)**
- 🤖 **Deep Learning for Molecular Science**
- 🌐 **Graph Neural Networks & Diffusion Models**
- 🔍 **Virtual Screening and Binding Affinity Prediction**
- ⚗️ **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**
- 💻 **End-to-end ML pipelines with reproducibility and physical fidelity**
  
Since **August 2024**, I've been a full-time researcher at HiTMer, working on projects that bridge physics-based simulation and machine learning — including differentiable force fields, generative modeling, and structure-based prediction frameworks.

All tools and models are implemented from scratch by me, with a strong focus on modularity, reproducibility, and physical accuracy.

## 🧰 Featured Tools & Projects

### 🔹 [MolPrism](https://github.com/cemuguz-lab/MolPrism-Molecular-Clustering-and-Analysis-Toolkit)
> **Molecular Clustering and Visualization Toolkit**

MolPrism is a high-performance command-line tool for clustering and analyzing molecular datasets. It helps researchers explore chemical libraries, identify structurally related compound groups, and select representative molecules for further study.

- Supports multiple clustering algorithms **(KMeans, DBSCAN, Agglomerative)**
- Automatic k-value optimization via **Elbow and Silhouette** methods
- Customizable **feature selection** from molecular descriptor sets
- **Representative molecule selection** using centroids or medoids
- **Parallel processing** for fast large-scale clustering
- PCA-based **2D visualization and detailed CSV reporting**
- Fully configurable via **command-line or YAML files**

### 🔹 [CAGE – ConformerTool](https://github.com/cemuguz-lab/CAGE-ConformerTool)
> **Conformer generation and grid filtering tool**

CAGE is a robust, parallelized Python tool for generating 3D conformers from SMILES strings, specifically designed to prepare ligands for docking simulations using tools like GNINA and AutoDock Vina.

- RDKit-based conformer generation with **MMFF94 minimization**
- Optional **tautomer standardization** and **hydrogen handling**
- **Conformer translation** & **filtering based on a 3D grid box**
- Outputs **multi-conformer SDF files** ready for docking
- Modular, **object-oriented architecture** for extensibility
- Optimized for high-throughput drug discovery pipelines
  
While advanced features like **RMSD-based pruning** are planned for future versions, CAGE already provides a solid foundation for efficient and reproducible conformer preprocessing workflows.

## 🚧 In Development

Currently building and refining:

- ⚛️ **Generative models** for protein-ligand 3D structure generation  
- 🧠 **Physics-Informed Diffusion Models** (PINN + DDPM hybrid)  
- 🧮 **CHARMM-based Differentiable Force Fields**  
- 🎵 A secret **Sonification Project** exploring molecular-to-sound translation  

Some of these efforts are being developed in collaboration with academic teams and are currently in active development or manuscript preparation. Others are under peer-review for scientific publication.

🔒 For this reason, their source code is not yet publicly available — but will be released alongside the corresponding academic articles once they are finalized.
