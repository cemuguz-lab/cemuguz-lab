# 👋 Hello! I’m Cem UĞUZ

I'm a **computational physicist (PhD)** and full-time researcher at [**HiTMer – Center for Computational Drug Design**](https://www.durdagilab.com), where I develop AI-powered tools and scientific pipelines for molecular modeling, dynamics simulations, and drug discovery.


---

## 🔬 What I Work On

I specialize in designing and implementing pipelines that integrate:

- 🧬 **Molecular Dynamics (GROMACS, NAMD, OpenMM)**
- 🤖 **Deep Learning for Molecular Science**
- 🌐 **Graph Neural Networks & Diffusion Models**
- 🔍 **Virtual Screening and Binding Affinity Prediction**
- ⚗️ **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**

Since **August 2024**, I've been a full-time researcher at HiTMer, working on projects that bridge physics-based simulation and machine learning — including differentiable force fields, generative modeling, and structure-based prediction frameworks.

All tools and models are implemented from scratch by me, with a strong focus on **modularity**, **reproducibility**, and **physical accuracy**.

## 📦 Featured Tools

### 🔹 [MolPrism – Molecular Clustering Toolkit](https://github.com/cemuguz-lab/MolPrism-Molecular-Clustering-and-Analysis-Toolkit)
> Explore molecular space with unsupervised clustering based on CNN-affinity. Visualize large conformer datasets in 2D/3D, identify chemical motifs, and extract key trends.

- Graph-based conformer analysis
- UMAP/PCA/t-SNE projections
- Publication-ready visualizations

---

### 🔹 [CAGE – ConformerTool](https://github.com/cemuguz-lab/CAGE-ConformerTool)
> Generate 3D conformers and docked poses for molecular datasets. Fast, customizable, and built for downstream ML integration.

- Open Babel + GNINA + RDKit integration
- Conformer filtering, sorting, and scoring
- Ready for virtual screening pipelines

## 🚧 Ongoing & Upcoming Work

In addition to the tools listed above, I’m actively developing a number of **AI-driven molecular modeling frameworks**, including:

- ⚛️ Generative models for protein-ligand complex generation
- 🧠 Physics-Informed Diffusion Models
- 🧮 Differentiable Force Field Modules (CHARMM-based)
- 🎵 Sonification Project (a surprise in the making)

Some of these efforts are being developed in collaboration with academic teams and are currently **in active development or manuscript preparation**. Others are under peer-review for scientific publication.

🔒 For this reason, their source code is **not yet publicly available** — but **will be released alongside the corresponding academic articles** once they are finalized.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Vision

I'm deeply committed to open-source science and building reusable infrastructure for **physics-aware AI in drug discovery**.

I created this GitHub space not only to share general-purpose cheminformatics tools, but also to eventually publish the **core engines** I’ve built for my academic research.

📢 I’m open to **collaborations**, particularly in:

- 🧠 **Generative AI for molecular systems**
- ⚗️ **Physics-Informed Machine Learning**
- 💊 **Computational Drug Discovery and Design**

If you're working in these areas or just want to exchange ideas, feel free to reach out.
